	"description": "The 'MNI Colin 27 Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model' is a stereotaxic average of 27 T1-weighted MRI scans of the same individual. It was created at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) in a two step process: (1) each of the 27 T1-weighted scans were registered to stereotaxic space using MRITOTAL (an automated volumetric registration procedure) and resampled onto a 1mm grid. All 27 scans were averaged together to create an initial average. (2) The initial average volume was used as a target for a second phase of registration where each original T1-weighted MRI was re-registered in stereotaxic space. This two-step procedure has the advantage of removing the small variance in intra-subject mapping in stereotaxic space associated with the use of a multi-subject average resulting in an average brain stereotaxic registration model with high signal-to-noise ratio and structure definition.",
