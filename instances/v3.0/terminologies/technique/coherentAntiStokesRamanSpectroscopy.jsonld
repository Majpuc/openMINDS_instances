  "definition": "A nonlinear Raman spectroscopy technique that employs multiple photons to address molecular vibrations, and produces a coherent signal. It uses a Stokes frequency stimulation beam and an anti-Stokes frequency beam is observed [adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_anti-Stokes_Raman_spectroscopy)].",
