  "definition": "A microbiology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane.",
  "description": "'Electroporation' is a process in which a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of the cell plasma membrane is caused by an externally applied electrical field. It is usually used in molecular biology as a way of introducing some substance into a cell, such as loading it with a molecular probe, a drug that can change the cell's function, or a piece of coding DNA.",
