  "definition": "Imaging technique that combines interferometry with short-coherence-length light to obtain micrometer-level depth resolution. Transverse scanning of the light beam is used to form two- and three-dimensional images, reflected from biological tissue or scattering media [Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography)].",
