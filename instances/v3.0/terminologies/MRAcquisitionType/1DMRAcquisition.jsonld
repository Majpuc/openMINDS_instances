    "definition": "Gradients establish a direct relationship between frequency and spatial position, a process referred to as frequency encoding.",
    "description": "In MRI, gradients generate a controlled variation in the magnetic field strength across the imaging volume. Each location along the gradient direction corresponds to a unique frequency in the received MR signal. This process, known as frequency encoding, allows spatial information to be extracted from the signal during image reconstruction.",
