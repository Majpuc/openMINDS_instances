  "additionalRemarks": "Brain region name and abbreviation listed in both chapter 'List of Abbreviations' and chapter 'List of Structures' of the 6th edition of The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (ISBN: 0-12-547612-4). Brain region name and abbreviation were taken from chapter 'List of Structures'. In 'List of Abbreviations', region name has a spelling mistake ('Kˆlliker' instead of 'Kîlliker'). The original name 'Kˆlliker-Fuse nucleus' has been added under 'alternateName'. 'Kôlliker-Fuse nucleus' was additionally added under 'alternateName' since this appears to be the more common name of the brain region.",
