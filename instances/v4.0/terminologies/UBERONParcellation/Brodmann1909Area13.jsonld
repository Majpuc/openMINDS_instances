  "description": "Brodmann area 13 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex as defined on the guenon monkey and on the basis of cytoarchitecture. Brodmann area 13 is found in humans, however it seems to act as a bridge between the lateral and medial layers of the brain. Thus it is sometimes misidentified as not being a Brodmann area.
