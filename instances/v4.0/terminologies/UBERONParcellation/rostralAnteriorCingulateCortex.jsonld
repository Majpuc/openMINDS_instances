  "definition": "'Rostral anterior cingulate cortex' is a regional part of brain. It is part of the anterior cingulate cortex.",
  "description": "Component of the cingulate cortex.  The rostral boundary was the first appearance of the cingulate sulcus (inferior to the superior frontal sulcus) whereas the caudal boundary was the first appearance of the genu of the corpus callosum. The medial boundary was the medial aspect of the cortex. The supero-lateral boundary was the superior frontal gyrus whereas the infero-lateral boundary was defined as the medial division of the orbitofrontal gyrus (Christine Fennema-Notestine).",
