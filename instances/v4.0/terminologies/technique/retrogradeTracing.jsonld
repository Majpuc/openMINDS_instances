  "definition": "Retrograde tracing is a technique used to trace neural connections from their point of termination (the synapse) to their source (the cell body).",
  "description": "In 'retrograde tracing' a tracer substance is taken up by synaptic terminals (and sometimes by axons) of neurons in the region where it is injected. Retrograde tracing techniques allow for a detailed assessment of neuronal connections between a target population of neurons and their inputs throughout the nervous system.",
