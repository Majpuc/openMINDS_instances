  "definition": "MRI acquisition type defines the method by which imaging data is collected, determining the spatial encoding strategy and affecting resolution, scan time, and overall image quality (Examples: 1D, 2D, 3D).",
  "description": "MRI acquisition type dictates how spatial and temporal information is encoded during image acquisition. It is classified based on the number of encoded dimensions: 2D acquisition captures individual slices sequentially using frequency * phase encoding, while 3D acquisition collects an entire volume in a single scan with frequency * phase * phase encoding, offering higher resolution and isotropic reconstruction. In rare cases, 1D acquisition is used for specialized applications like MR spectroscopy, encoding data along a single frequency dimension. The choice of acquisition type depends on clinical and research needs, balancing factors such as scan efficiency, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio.",
